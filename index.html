          Food insecurity has been on the rise for years, but COVID-19 has presented new challenges.

          "Sadly, it's not getting better," said Janis Robinson, vice president of institutions and partnerships at Food Bank NYC.

        <p>
          "I do imagine more lines... We have gone well over our regular year of distribution since Covid.
          We just don't expect that to go down, that number is only going to go up."

          Some boroughs have been hit harder than others. In the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn where food and job insecurity were already high, food pantries and soup kitchens have had to close at an alarming rate, adding to the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If somebody comes from anywhere in the five boroughs and expresses need, then we want to make sure we get them support and their needs meet," said Robinson.
